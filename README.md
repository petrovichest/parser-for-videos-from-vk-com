# parser-for-videos-from-vk-com

This small program downloads all videos from the vk.com group.
To do this, fill in the files in the "in" folder and run the script, indicating the number of threads and count of videos pages in the main class of the program.
The program uses the threading module to speed up the loading of images.
The results of the work can be seen in the out folder.
